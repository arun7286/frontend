  Conclusion
  In JavaScript, there are three main ways to declare a variable:
    1). let – used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
    2). const – used for variables whose values should not change.
    3). var – an older way of declaring variables; it’s best avoided in modern JavaScript due to potential scope issues.
